To provide more details in your README.md file for your 1536-Well Microtiter Plate Heatmap application, let's expand on some sections and add more context:

# 1536-Well Microtiter Plate Heatmap

# Overview
This application enables users to analyze data from a 1536-well microtiter plate by visualizing it as a heatmap. Users can upload CSV files containing data for each well, select metrics of interest, and interact with the heatmap to gain insights into the dataset.


### Features

- **Data Upload** :  Users can upload CSV files that contain data for each well in a 1536-well microtiter plate.

- **Heatmap Visualization**:: The data is presented as a heatmap, where each well's value is represented by a color gradient based on the selected metric.

- **Interactivity**: Hovering over each well displays detailed information in a tooltip, providing users with specific data points.

- **Metric Selection**: Users can choose which metric to visualize from the uploaded dataset, facilitating comparative analysis.

- **Error Handling**: The application incorporates error boundaries to gracefully handle and display errors encountered during data parsing or visualization.

- **Code Splitting**: Performance is optimized through lazy loading and code splitting, ensuring efficient resource utilization.


### External Packages
-**react-error-boundary**: Used for implementing error boundaries to capture and display errors within components.

-**papaparse**: A fast and powerful CSV parser for parsing uploaded data files.

-**react-bootstrap**: Provides UI components and styles for a consistent and responsive user interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Version 18 or higher.
- npm: Package manager for Node.js.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hiteshsinghal92/microtiter-plate
   cd microtiter-heatmap

2. Install dependencies:
    
    ### `npm install`

3. Run the application:

    ### `npm start`

4. Open the application in your browser:

- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the application.

### Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

    Build the Docker Image: Open a terminal, navigate to the root of your React application directory, and run:

    ### `docker build . -t "microtiter-heatmap:v1.0"`

2. Run the Docker Container:

    ### `docker run -p 3000:3000 microtiter-heatmap:v1.0`


### Project Structure
- The project directory structure is organized as follows:

- src/: Contains the main source code of the application.
-    components/: React components used in the application.
-    services/: Utility functions and services, such as CSV parsing.
-    constants/: Application constants, such as expected headers in CSV files.
-    App.js: Main entry point of the application.
-    index.js: Renders the root component into the DOM.
- public/: Static assets and HTML file for the application.


### CSV File Format
- The CSV file uploaded to the application should adhere to the following format:

-    Contains 1536 rows, each representing a well in the microtiter plate.
-    Includes columns for each metric or data point to be visualized.
-    Data should be properly formatted without missing or empty values in required columns.
-    **Microtiter.csv** correct format file inside microtiter-plate.zip root folder
-    **Data.csv** incorrect format file to check error microtiter-plate.zip root folder



### Code Documentation
-   ErrorBoundary.jsx: Implements error boundaries to catch and display errors in components.
-   DataUpload.jsx: Manages CSV file upload, including validation and error handling.
-   HeatMap.jsx: Renders the heatmap visualization based on uploaded data and selected metrics.
-   MetricsList.jsx: Provides a dropdown menu for users to select metrics for visualization.
-   parseCSV.jsx: Parses uploaded CSV data, validates its format, and prepares it for visualization.
